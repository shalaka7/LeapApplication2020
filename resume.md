### Projects
- [Perception, Control and Planning module for Autonomous Car-Driving :](https://github.com/shalaka7/Autonomous-Car-Driving-Project) Perform path planning for a car, Identify objects in frame using RADAR-LiDAR fusion with Kalaman Filter, develop functional safety of lane assistance system
- [Use of deep learning for behavioral cloning :](mailto:https://github.com/shalaka7/Behavioral-Cloning) Built and trained a convolutional neural network for end to end driving in simulator using TensorFlow and Keras. Used optimization techniques such as regularization and dropout to generalize the network for driving on multiple tracks.
- [Vehicle Detection and Tracking :](https://github.com/shalaka7/udacity_project_5) Created a vehicle tracking pipeline with OpenCV, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and support vector machines(SVM). Optimized and evaluated the model on video data from automotive camera taken during highway driving.
- [Vehicle Speed Estimation and Tracking from Video Stream :](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8256736) Designed and implemented velocity prediction engine across frames in video in MATLAB.
